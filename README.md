# Forked from Andrej Karpathy Repo NANO GPT

This is a nano gpt architecture trained on data from Caltech.edu domains. Below is an example of the output.  Note that this uses characters rather than tokens as the encodings. This means that instead of predicting the next word the model is predicting the next character.

# nanogpt-lecture

Code created in the [Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) video lecture series, specifically on the first lecture on nanoGPT. Publishing here as a Github repo so people can easily hack it, walk through the `git log` history of it, etc.
